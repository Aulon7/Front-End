                            <p>A credit score is a three digit number that is determined by your credit report information and predicts how likely you’re going to pay back a loan in time. This number can vary from 300 to 850, and the higher your score, the more responsible your lenders will believe you are and the more likely they are to give you the loan you’re applying for.</p>

                                As we get older, we get wiser. According to the most recent data, the average FICO score usually improves with age. Ages 18 to 23, also known as the Gen Z, have an average credit score of 674, which falls into the Good category. A slight improvement can be noticed in the millennials (age 24-39) who have an average score of 680. Additionally, people aged 40 to 55 have a credit score of 699; whereas, ages 56 to 74 and over 75 lead the list with the average score of 736, respectfully 758.

                                The average credit score tends to increase in a parallel line with one’s income. Even though debt-to-income ratio doesn’t directly determine your credit score, it indirectly plays an essential role since one’s credit utilization is one of the most important factors that lenders consider while evaluating your credit risk. You can <a href="https://www.mycreditsummit.com/credit-builder-loans/" target="_blank">boost your credit score</a> by keeping your credit utilization below 30%.

                            <h2>How To Improve Your Credit Score?</h2>
                            <p>Never underestimate the value of a good credit score, because you never know when you may need it. And even if you don’t have the best credit score you could wish for, don’t give up as there are numerous ways you can improve your credit score.</p>
                            <h3>Pay Your Bills on Time</h3>
                            <p>If there’s one thing lenders want to see, that’s a responsible credit manager. By paying your bills on time, you ensure that your payment history stays impeccable, thus increasing your chances of securing better loaning terms.<br>
                            If you worry that you might forget to pay your bills on time, there’s a solution for that as well. You can set up automatic bill payments, and that will be taken care of while you focus on other aspects of improving your credit.</p>
                            <h3>Don’t apply for unnecessary loans</h3>
                            <p>We know that no one goes out to take a loan just because they feel like it; however, you should try and determine whether it’s really necessary and you have no other option. Taking multiple loans may reduce your credit accounts’ average age, thus impacting your FICO score.</p>
                            <h3>Track Your Credit Score</h3>
                            <p>Think of your credit score like your health. If you monitor your symptoms and immediately require intervention if something’s not right, you might save your life. Well, the same thing can be said about your credit score. By constantly monitoring it, you can immediately intervene if it drops. </p>
                            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                            <p>Having a proper understanding of how credit scores work is essential, no matter if you have an excellent score or you’re rebuilding your poor score. The importance of it lies in the fact that lenders will always look at your credit score before approving or rejecting your loan request, and about <a href="https://upgradedpoints.com/credit-cards/credit-score-facts-statistics/" target="_blank">90% of lenders consider and use the FICO Score</a> as the most accurate.</p>
